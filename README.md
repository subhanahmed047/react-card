# React-Card &middot; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/subhanahmed047/react-card.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/subhanahmed047/react-card)

A simple react component that uses the flexbox and styled-components to create a card layout.

Demo: https://subhanahmed047.github.io/react-card/

## Getting Started

Clone the project and run the following command to get started:
```
yarn start
```

## Running the tests

To run the test just run the following command:

```
yarn test
```

## CI Process
I have used _travis CI_ to automate the build and test process for this project. On every build it tests the app and deploys it to github pages. 

## External Libraries Used

* [Styled-Components](https://www.styled-components.com)

## Approach Used:
I used css flexbox to design this commponent because of its space distribution and alignment capabilities. It makes a difficult task very easy and clean as you don't have to write a lot of styles yourself.
